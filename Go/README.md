# Go Projects

This directory contains multiple Go projects that I am working on to enhance my knowledge of the Go programming language. Each project is isolated in its own subdirectory with a `go.mod` file to manage dependencies.

## Project Structure

- **project1/**: [placeholder]
- **project2/**: [placeholder]
- **project3/**: [placeholder]

I will update this README with project details as I continue adding new projects.

Feel free to explore the individual project directories for further details.
