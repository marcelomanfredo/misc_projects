# Go Projects

This repository contains multiple Go projects I'm building to improve my skills in the Go programming language.

## Project Structure

---

### Document Validator

A command-line tool for validating Brazilian document numbers.

So far, I've implemented logic for:
- **CPF**

**TODO:** Add support for MOD10 and MOD11 checksum algorithms, which are widely used in Brazilian documents like:
- **CNPJ**
- **TÃ­tulo de Eleitor**
- **PIS**
- **CNH** (which has some custom validation rules)

### Document Parser

A small tool to parse a custom CSV format and calculate specific fields, particularly:
- `Value`
- `Duration`

This project is mostly experimental and may not be used in production, but the parsing and calculation logic could be helpful for others.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Each project is self-contained and serves as a focused exercise in learning Go.
- I'll update this README as I add new projects or enhance existing ones.
- Feel free to explore the individual project directories for more details and source code.
